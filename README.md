## Hello, I'm Annan! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Annan Dejene. I am a high school student passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning. I learn everyday by taking online courses and  reading books. I have experience working with Python and some of its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn. I am currently learning about neural networks. I try to reinforce what I learn by doing projects.
